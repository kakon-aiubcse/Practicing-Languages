#tuples in array
#tuples are like string immutable means can't change values 
#for making tuples we use paranthesis
tup = (2,2,4,'abcd',3)
print(tup)
print(type(tup))
#should give first value with comma to define tuple 
print(tup[1:3])
print(tup.count('abcd'))
print(tup.index('abcd'))
print(len(tup))
